Theater_Simulation
==================

This is a c++ program that I originally created for my class. 

## Installation

Download the repository.

You need to make sure to have movies.txt and project2.cpp in the same directory. 

You are able to customize movies.txt, but be sure that each movie has a tab character between the movie name and the available tickets

## Running the Simulation
Open a terminal and navigate to the Code directory.

To run the program, use the command:

    ./program2 

If you want to re-compile the code, use the command:

    g++ -o project2 project2.cpp -pthread -lrt
